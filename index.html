            (GreenSock Animation Platform) library. This initiative was born out
            of a personal desire to sharpen and expand my animation development
            skills by creating visually engaging and dynamic web experiences.
            With a focus on clean design, smooth transitions, and immersive user
            interactions, Creative Club serves as both a creative outlet and a
            technical playground for front-end experimentation. The project is
            structured to be easily understood and reused by others in the
            developer community, encouraging collaboration, learning, and
            further development.
