              (GreenSock Animation Platform) library. This initiative was born
              out of a personal desire to sharpen and expand my animation
              development skills by creating visually engaging and dynamic web
              experiences. With a focus on clean design, smooth transitions, and
              immersive user interactions, Creative Club serves as both a
              creative outlet and a technical playground for front-end
              experimentation. The project is structured to be easily understood
              and reused by others in the developer community, encouraging
              collaboration, learning, and further development.
